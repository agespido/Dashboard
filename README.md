# Financial Dashboard with Streamlit

This project creates a financial dashboard using Streamlit, a Python library for building web applications. The dashboard reads financial data from an Excel file and displays key performance indicators (KPIs), asset allocation, and the evolution of assets over time.

## Installation

To run the financial dashboard, you need to install the required Python libraries that are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the financial dashboard, you can use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This command will start a local web server and open the financial dashboard in your default web browser. You can interact with the dashboard by selecting a date using the slider widget, which will update the charts and KPIs based on the selected date.
